      <p>Dear Cousin:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> On page 100 is an explanation of the cost of production of this book.
        The desire is to get away from a rigid form of rendering a bill for each
        book; and yet if we are to perpetuate the scheme somebody must foot the
        bills. It is not the intention to amplify here the thought on page 100.
        I hope the sentiment which I have tried to express on that page will
        have an appeal. Won't you please reread that page? If for each book
        manufactured three dollars is remitted, the cost of the edition will be
        met. Where, through duplication of books within a family or household, a
        smaller average remittance is justified--and it would be justified in
        several cases--it is hoped that the deficit so caused may be made up by
        others so circumstanced and so disposed that they can conveniently and
        cheerfully lend this encouragement to the plan. Should the aggregate
        remittance exceed the total cost of the edition, the balance will be
        held to reduce the cost of the next volume. </p>
      <p> Please send your remittance to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1050">Mary
          Snavely</a>,<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. A. B.
        Snavely,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 211 Tenth

        D.C.<br>
        <br>
        It would be appreciated if the settlements could be made with reasonable
        promptness, as personal funds have been advanced for the production
        expenses. </p>
