    <h2>2020 Campbells of Nelson Reunion</h2>
    <div>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHEN</span>. Our reunions are
        held every other year. Our next reunion will be held Sat., Aug 1, 2020
        in Nelson, Tioga Co, PA. Put that date on your calendar. If you live far
        away, schedule next year's vacation so you can come to Nelson then and
        get (re)acquainted with your roots.</p>
      <p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHERE</span>. As with our
        2014 though 2018 reunions, it will be held at the <a href="http://www.unitedchurchofnelson.com/">United
          Church of Nelson</a>, 75 Village Dr., Nelson, PA 16940. Their
        community room is in the basement, but there is a stair glide chair for
        those who have problems with stairs. The original Beecher's Island
        Presbyterian church building, hand built by our ancestors, was
        demolished. But its congregation merged with that of Nelson's Methodist
        Church, so its the successor to the congregation our ancestors created
        in 1844. Nelson is about 6 miles west of Lawrenceville, PA, which is on
        US15 (the future I-99), just below the New York State line. Nelson is
        about half a mile north of PA49. For those flying, Elmira, NY is the
        closest airport.</p>
      <p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT</span>. Registration
        will start at 10 AM.followed by introductions and memorabilia a at 11
        AM, followed by by a covered dish picnic about noon, then a business
        meeting, remarks and wrapping up around 3 PM on Saturday. It's indoors,
        so it will be held rain or shine. We can arrange tours of Cowanesque
        Valley cemeteries. If you are interested in taking a tour, please let us
        know. Take a look at the many pages of <a href="CemeteriesByState.html">our
          family's graves</a>.</p>
      <p> Please bring memorabilia (old photos or items handed down thru the
        generations) for others to see.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AUCTION</span>. Please
        consider donating family memorabilia that we can auction at the reunion
        to raise funds for this organization. It's a good way to assure that
        items that your kids may not be interested in will stay "in the family"
        and be appreciated.</p>
      <p> Contact us with your offers of assistance and suggestions. Hopefully
        suggestions of "I think there should be ___" will be accompanied by "and
        I'll be glad to help by ___".</p>
