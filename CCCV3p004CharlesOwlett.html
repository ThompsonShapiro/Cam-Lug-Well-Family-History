      <p>Dear Campbell Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Well, as you have urged me to write, I'll try and say a few words. </p>
      <p>I have a nice fat boy to add to your list of cousins. His name is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1158">Charles
          Butler Owlett</a>. He was eight months old the twentieth of this
        month. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1157">Marth
          <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span> Ann</a> was four years old the
        tenth of February, but she doesn't walk yet<sup>1</sup>. However, she is
        gaining every day now, and we are hoping that she can walk before long.</p>
      <p>We have just attended church. Mr. Alty preached a wonderful sermon on
        the works of the Holy Ghost in the lives of men. I have been a little
        unfortunate this winter. Was out of work about three months, but
        business is picking up some now.</p>
      <p>We were all glad to see <a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Mother Owlett</a>
        back home with us again after her Washington trip.</p>
      <p>Best wishes to all the cousins,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Reportedly Martha had polio plus some developmental problems and was
        cared for all her life by her very dedicated mother.</p>
