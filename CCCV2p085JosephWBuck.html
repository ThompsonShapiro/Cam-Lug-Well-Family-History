    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p><span class="Annotation"></span>I wish to apologize for my failure to
        have answered your previous letters, requesting report <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>
        for the Cousins' Book. My work has taken so much of my time<sup>1</sup>
        during the past few months that I have been compelled to neglect any
        personal matters. My neglect, however, does not indicate any lack of
        interest in the good work that is being done.</p>
      <p>I had intended to work up some information in reference to our <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">
          great-grandfather Campbell</a>, which I believe would be of interest
        to all.</p>
      <p>When we broke up <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1540">grandmother</a>'s
        home, I discovered some old copy-books and a diary which were dated
        around 1810-1820. Evidently some pages are missing from the diary, and
        part of the writing is illegible, so that it would take quite a little
        time to translate and compile the information contained therein<sup>2</sup>.
        The first pages of the diary show the sale of certain property in
        Londonderry, Ireland, which evidently was done just prior to the time
        that the Campbells came to this country<sup>3</sup>. There is some
        description of the voyage over to America. They landed in Perth Amboy
        and then came up the Susquehanna River to Williamsport and from
        Williamsport they finally came to Nelson<sup>4</sup>. There is quite a
        vivid description of the character of the country, the crops that could
        be grown and the abundance of game, such as bears, deer and the like<sup>5</sup>.</p>
      <p> I am going to make every effort to see if I cannot write up an
        interesting resume of the papers which I have. I first contemplated
        having photostatic copies made, but I do not believe that this would be
        practical as the writing is faded and the pages discolored to such an
        extent that I am sure we could not get clear copies. </p>

    <div class="Footnote"> 1. For a small law firm in a small city, Joe had an
      amazing list of corporate clients, including being counsel for Corning
      Glass. He definitely was "a local boy who made good."<br>
      <br>
      2. Many of us would give our eye teeth for that diary or a transcription
      of it. Joe's son, Joseph C. Buck, looked and looked for it among his
      parents' papers, but to no avail. However, Joseph W. did included key
      excerpts of the diary in his letter the following year. --- see Vol. 3,
      p.72. A careful reading of those excerpt leads me to conclude that the
      diary was not that of Joe's great-grandfather, but that of his <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">great-great-grandfather</a>,
      also named Joseph.<br>
      <br>
      3. Our Campbells didn't all come then, Portions came in at least 3
      separate voyages. See "<a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ecapane/WhoCameWhen.html">Who
        Came When</a>". <br>
      <br>
      4. Only the Joseph Campbell born in 1748, wife Mary Harper, and their
      youngest children sailed to Perth Amboy, NJ. The other members of the
      family were mostly in Lancaster Co., PA or Philadelphia. Some remained in
      Lancaster Co. and never came to Nelson. Those going to Nelson assembled at
      the farm of <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a>, which at
      that time may have been near Stroudsburg, PA, or may have been in
      Lancaster Co., PA. If it was near Stroudsburg,&nbsp; they would have
      followed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Route_115">Sullivan
        Trail</a> to the Susquehanna at Wilkes-Barre. Or, if Sam's farm was
      still in Lancaster Co. they would have reached the Susquehanna at, or
      below, Harrisburg. Regardless of where they reached the Susquehanna, the
      party split up. The women and children followed&nbsp; Sullivan's routefrom
      Willkes-Barre to Painted Post, NY, then picked up a road going South to
      Lawrenceville, PA. There were no roads along the Cowanesque then, but they
      followed trails to the Beecher's Island (later the site of Nelson). The
      livestock, accompanied by most of the men, followed the West Branch of the
      Susquehanna to Williamsport, as Joe described. And then came north to
      Beecher's Island. <br>
      <br>
      5. The valley was filled with a virgin forest of Eastern White Pine --
      very tall. To the pioneers they were weeds, to be cut down and disposed of
      via huge bon fires. They were so plentiful (and in the way of farming)
      that it wasn't till later that the settlers realized the could be sold as
      lumber. Other wildlife included elk, cougar, and wolves.<br>

      <p>In reading over these old papers, I am impressed more and more with the
        fact that in our day and age our life is pretty easy, - that we do not
        and cannot understand the great debt which we owe our forefathers for
        their labor and efforts in opening up what was then a wilderness. </p>
      <p>I trust that all will accept my humble apologies for my apparent lack
        of interest and neglect in submitting my report.</p>
