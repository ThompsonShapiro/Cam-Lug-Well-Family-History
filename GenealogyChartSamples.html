    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Genealogy Chart Choices</h2>
    <p>As an incentive for early registration for our Aug 2, 2014 Campbell
      Reunion, we would like to offer a chart of the registrant's ancestry, to
      be picked up at the reunion. We are asking you to pick a format to be used
      for all of&nbsp; these reports. </p>
    <p>Below are examples of three different report formats for showing you
      ancestry, Choices A &amp; B only show ancestors, Choice C shows both
      ancestors and descendants. Cousin Treva HOOKER Hazlett (no snickers
      please) was selected for the sample charts because she has no living
      descendants and thus no privacy concerns apply. (She had 2 children, but
      no grandchildren.)</p>
    <p>These charts show 5 or 6 generations. We now have 10 generations of
      Campbells, and even more for Luggs and Blackwells. So, if we give you a
      chart of all of your ancestors that are in our tree, printing it out
      require several pages --- which you can tape together or put in a nice
      ringbinder or scrapbook.</p>
    <p>Please pick your favorite.</p>
