    <div class="Salutation">
      <p>Dear Cousins:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Message">
      <p> Am very sure that Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will Selph</a>
        has never been grandmother to three babies with measles or he would not
        have asked me to write a letter even as important as the Cousins
        Correspondence letter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We have not only had measles but measles plus. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1266">Baby
          Henry</a> has had bronchitis and an abscess in both ears and a sixteen
        month old baby with all that trouble is considerable care. However, we
        hope they are all on the road to complete recovery.</p>
      <p> As <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1285">Isabelle</a>
        has written the family letter since I have been here<sup>1</sup> you
        will have to pardon me if we tell the same story.</p>
      <p> Talked with <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1276">Betty</a>
        last evening. They have a dandy <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1282">baby
          boy</a> but think Joseph will always come first with his "Gram." He
        has just had his half term examinations and passed all his subjects
        above ninety, which I think pretty good for an eight year old boy.</p>
      <p>Am afraid <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1256">Tom</a>,
        <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1250">Jess</a>'
        boy, will not be able to go back to school this year. He has a slight
        valvular heart trouble and measles have left him far from strong.</p>
      <p>Isabelle wrote yesterday from Atlantic City that she was enjoying her
        Easter vacation<sup>2</sup> very much She expects to visit Philadelphia
        and Harrisburg on her way home.</p>
      <p>Anticipating much pleasure from the Cousins letters, I extend greetings
        to you all from Jessica and myself.</p>

    <div class="Closing">Very truly yours,</div>

    <div class="Footnote">
      <p>1. Most of the year Frances lived with her youngest daughter, Isabelle,
        but my mother was a teacher, so she needed childcare when my siblings
        were sick. I was not yet part of the scene in 1924 (nor for quite a
        while after) - wbt</p>
      <p>2. Isabelle was a P.E. teacher. - wbt</p>
